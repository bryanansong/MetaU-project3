### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?
  -  I do not think the labs were enough practice to build the web app that was required of us. I wish we had a slower and more hands-on session to get better at learning backend technologies

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  - If I had more time, I would have added the user management feature where each user can have their own accounts and commit actions under their username

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
  - My database schema was well planned and that really helped me speedrun a lot of my work because I didn't have to go back and redo my schema based on the new requirements I was seeing

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
